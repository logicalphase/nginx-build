Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire

generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 281 more bytes)
```

Just open another terminal window and run some commands which generates plenty of activity.

My favorite is running a disk write performance benchmark using:

```bash
dd bs=1M count=1024 if=/dev/zero of=test conv=fdatasync
```

### List Keys:

```bash
^_^[Mitesh@Shah:~]$ gpg --list-keys
/home/mitesh/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
------------------------
pub   4096R/387AFF02 2014-04-21
uid                  Mitesh Shah (rtCamp Launchpad) <Mr.Miteshah@gmail.com>
sub   4096R/0B9C8B2D 2014-04-21
```

### Making An ASCII Armored Version Your Public Key:

```bash
^_^[Mitesh@Shah:~]$ gpg --output MiteshShah.asc --export -a $GPGKEY
```

NOTE: In This Example $GPGKEY = 387AFF02


### Upload Keys To Ubuntu Key Server:

```bash
^_^[Mitesh@Shah:~]$ gpg --send-keys --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com $GPGKEY
```

### GPG Key FingerPrint:

```bash
^_^[Mitesh@Shah:~]$ gpg --fingerprint
/home/mitesh/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
------------------------
pub   4096R/387AFF02 2014-04-21
      Key fingerprint = 80D6 A2F6 AA2F E34F 0E3A  C850 0E18 6538 387A FF02
uid                  Mitesh Shah (rtCamp Launchpad) <Mr.Miteshah@gmail.com>
